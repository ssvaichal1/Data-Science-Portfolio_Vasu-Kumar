## Projects: 
- **Machine Learning**

     - [Natural Language Processing using NLTK on eBooks](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Natural-Language-Processing-using-NLTK-on-eBooks/blob/master/NLTK_Books.ipynb) : There are 8 different text files of ebooks which are available freely on http://www.gutenberg.org/ . Steps Performed: Importing of text files to python, Text Parsing and transformation operations are performed such as lower case conversion, removal of special characters, contraction words, tokenizing etc., Tagging parts of speech to each term, Stemming terms to get their root word, Stop Word Removal. The project also shows the difference in the outcome when POS Tagging, Stop Word Removal and Stemming operations are not performed.

    - [Prediction Analysis of Risky Credit for a credit card company using Neural Networks and Random Forests](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Prediction-Analysis-of-Risky-Credit-ANN-RF-DT-/blob/master/Credit%20History%20_Risk%20(1).ipynb) : Developed a model to determine the credit risk for a customer based on the attributes. Performed data imputations using one-hot method. The Random Forest model results the accuracy of 78%, Recall of 93.24%, precision of 80.23% and F1 score of 86.25%. The training model for Random forest however shows 95.71% Accuracy, which shows overfitting of curve. Hence we rely on neural network with Neural Network - 6,5.  

    - [Recommender system for Groceries Contractor](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Recommender-System-for-Groceries-Contractor/blob/master/Groceries%20Recommender%20System%20(1).ipynb) : Determined the highest restaurant-joints cluster center (at Agincourt) for the groceries contractor in one of the boroughs of Toronto (Scarborough). Produced folium maps visualization

    - [Loan Default predictive modelling for a customer of a Multinational Bank](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Loan-Default-Prediction/blob/master/Loan%20Default%20Classifier.ipynb) : A classification model to accurately detect if a customer is going to default the loan/ credit payments. The goal is to understand the important factors affecting the loan status and building an optimized classification model. I have used kNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Logistic regression algorithm.

    - [Mine-Rock classifier based on Sonar data inputs](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Mine-vs-Rock-Classifier---SONAR-Data/blob/master/Mine%20Sonar%20Classifier.ipynb) : I have used a sonar data inputs (signals bouncing off from metal and rock surfaces). I have used analysis for outlier and missing value identification and imputation.  A classification model is built to detect if the signals contribute or predict the presence of a Mine or a Rock.

    - [Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecommunications Company](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Customer-Churn-Analysis-for-a-Telecommunications-Company/blob/master/Customer%20Churn%20Analysis%20for%20a%20Telecommunications%20Company.ipynb) : I have used a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights that can be used immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.

    - [Data Analytics of Diamond Pricing and its associated features](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Data-Analytics-of-Diamond-Prices-and-Features/blob/master/Data%20Preprocessing%20(1).ipynb) : I have built a linear regression model in order to accurately predict the diamond prices based on the features. The features are Price, Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Depth, Tabl, X, Y, and Z dimensions. The Data consists of many missing values which are assessed and analysed in order to proceed for model building. Objectives included Metadata Preparation, Outlier Analysis, Missing Value Imputation, New Attribute Creation and Attribute Encoding.

    - Data Analytics and exploration of Diamond pricing [SAS] : Performed outlier analysis, missing value imputation, attribute encoding, determined important features responsible for diamond pricing. Performed forward -backward and stepwise linear regressions to predict the diamond pricing
    
    - Prediction of the file claim for an insured car [R] : Achieved 84% accuracy with sensitivity of 73%. Analyzed 1,00,000 observations and 52 factors with 6.2% missing values. 12 Important features selected (Subset selection, Ridge and LASSO)

    - Movie recommender system using collaborative filtering : Developed user-based recommendation system using Pearson correlation function. Recommendation given based on the similarity scores

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**
    - [Data Analysis of Immigration Data for Canada](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Immigration-Data---Visual-Analytics/blob/master/Immigration%20Data%20-%20Visualization%20Analytics%20(2).ipynb) : I have performed data cleaning and used visual plots to represent immigration to Canada by continents over different time periods, understand Japanese, Chinese and Indian immigrants from 1980-2013, regression plots to understand the immigration pattern, and Analyzing the effect of Argentina's great depression.
    
     - [Advanced Visualizations for Immigration Data and Novel](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Advanced-Data-Visualizations---Immigration-Data-and-Novel/blob/master/Advanced%20Visual%20Analytics%20-%20Immigration%20Data%20and%20Novel.ipynb) : The objective of the project is the exploration of datasets, Visualizing Data (Waffle Charts, Word Clouds, Regression Plots). Assessment of Denmark, Sweden and Norway for total immigration is shown via waffle plot. The project shows the word cloud along with masking with frequent words occurrence (excluding non important words). Also, the majority of the people who immigrated came from one of 15 countries that are displayed by the word cloud. The regression plots discuss the immigration pattern over the years.
