## Projects: 
- **Machine Learning**

    - [Recommender system for Groceries Contractor](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Recommender-System-for-Groceries-Contractor/blob/master/Groceries%20Recommender%20System%20(1).ipynb) : Determined the highest restaurant-joints cluster center (at Agincourt) for the groceries contractor in one of the boroughs of Toronto (Scarborough). Produced folium maps visualization

    - [Loan Default predictive modelling for a cutomer of a Multinational Bank](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Loan-Default-Prediction/blob/master/Loan%20Default%20Classifier.ipynb) : A classification modelto accurately detect if a customer is goign to default the loan/ credit payments. The goal is to understand the important factors affecting the loan status and building an optimized classification model. I have used kNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Logistic regression algorithm.
    
    - [Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecommunications Company](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Customer-Churn-Analysis-for-a-Telecommunications-Company/blob/master/Customer%20Churn%20Analysis%20for%20a%20Telecommunications%20Company.ipynb) : I have used a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights that can be used immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.

- **Data Analytics and exploration of Diamond pricing [SAS] :** Performed outlier analysis, missing value imputation, attribute encoding, determined important features responsible for diamond pricing. Performed forward -backward and stepwise linear regressions to predict the diamond pricing
- **Phase 1 Analysis of Multivariate Quality Control Data for an Industrial Forging Process :** Estimated distribution parameters from within control data point to use it as monitoring scheme for future quality control missions (Phase 2 Analysis).
- **Prediction of the file claim for an insured car :** Achieved 84% accuracy with sensitivity of 73%. Analyzed 1,00,000 observations and 52 factors with 6.2% missing values. 12 Important features selected (Subset selection, Ridge and LASSO)
- **Movie recommender system using collaborative filtering :** Developed user-based recommendation system using Pearson correlation function. Recommendation given based on the similarity scores
- **Prediction of Network Intrusion detection by analyzing the TCP/IP dump :** Achieved 75% accuracy with the Random Forest/ Decision Tree model. Analyzed 25193 records along with data cleaning and feature selection of TCP/IP Dump data
- **E-Commerce Sales Analytics Visualization [Tableau] :** Performed data organization, advanced visualization, mapping, enterprise dashboards, and data presentation
