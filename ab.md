## Projects: 
- **Recommender system for Groceries Contractor :** Determined the highest restaurant-joints cluster center (at Agincourt) for the groceries contractor in one of the boroughs of Toronto (Scarborough). Produced folium maps visualization
- **Data Analytics and exploration of Diamond pricing [SAS] :** Performed outlier analysis, missing value imputation, attribute encoding, determined important features responsible for diamond pricing. Performed forward -backward and stepwise linear regressions to predict the diamond pricing
