## Projects: 
- **Machine Learning**

    - [Recommender system for Groceries Contractor](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Recommender-System-for-Groceries-Contractor/blob/master/Groceries%20Recommender%20System%20(1).ipynb) : Determined the highest restaurant-joints cluster center (at Agincourt) for the groceries contractor in one of the boroughs of Toronto (Scarborough). Produced folium maps visualization

    - [Loan Default predictive modelling for a cutomer of a Multinational Bank](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Loan-Default-Prediction/blob/master/Loan%20Default%20Classifier.ipynb) : A classification model to accurately detect if a customer is goign to default the loan/ credit payments. The goal is to understand the important factors affecting the loan status and building an optimized classification model. I have used kNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Logistic regression algorithm.

    - [Mine-Rock classifier based on Sonar data inputs](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Mine-vs-Rock-Classifier---SONAR-Data/blob/master/Mine%20Sonar%20Classifier.ipynb) : I have used a sonar data inputs (singals bouncing off from metal and rock surfaces). I have used analysis for outlier and missing value identification and imputatation.  A classification model is built to detect if the signals contribute or predict the presence of a Mine or a Rock.

    - [Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecommunications Company](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Customer-Churn-Analysis-for-a-Telecommunications-Company/blob/master/Customer%20Churn%20Analysis%20for%20a%20Telecommunications%20Company.ipynb) : I have used a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights that can be used immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.

    - [Data Analytics of Diamond Pricing and its associated features](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Data-Analytics-of-Diamond-Prices-and-Features/blob/master/Data%20Preprocessing%20(1).ipynb) : I have built a linear regression model in order to accurately predict the diamond prices based on the feautres. The features are Price, Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Depth, Tabl, X, Y, and Z dimensions. The Data consists of many missin values which are assessed and analysed in order to proceed for model building. Objectives included Metadata Preparation, Outlier Analysis, Missing Value Imputation, New Attribute Creation and Attribute Encoding.

    - Data Analytics and exploration of Diamond pricing [SAS] : Performed outlier analysis, missing value imputation, attribute encoding, determined important features responsible for diamond pricing. Performed forward -backward and stepwise linear regressions to predict the diamond pricing
    
    - Prediction of the file claim for an insured car [R] : Achieved 84% accuracy with sensitivity of 73%. Analyzed 1,00,000 observations and 52 factors with 6.2% missing values. 12 Important features selected (Subset selection, Ridge and LASSO)

    - Movie recommender system using collaborative filtering : Developed user-based recommendation system using Pearson correlation function. Recommendation given based on the similarity scores

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**
    - [Data Analysis of Immigration Data for Canada](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Immigration-Data---Visual-Analytics/blob/master/Immigration%20Data%20-%20Visualization%20Analytics%20(2).ipynb) : I have performed data cleaning and used visual plots to represent immigration to Canada by continents over different time periods, understand Japenese, Chinese and Indian immigrants from 1980-2013, regression plots to understand the immigration pattern, and Analyzign the effect of Argentina's great depression.
    
     - [Advanced Visualizations for Immigration Data and Novel](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Advanced-Data-Visualizations---Immigration-Data-and-Novel/blob/master/Advanced%20Visual%20Analytics%20-%20Immigration%20Data%20and%20Novel.ipynb) : The objective of the project is the exploration of datasets, Visualizing Data (Waffle Charts, Word Clouds, Regression Plots). Assessment of Denmark, Sweden and Norway for total immigration is shown via waffle plot. The project shows the word cloud along with masking with frequenct words occerence (excluding non important words). Also, the majority of the people who immigrated came from one of 15 countries that are displayed by the word cloud. The regression plots discusses the immigration pattern over the years.    
    
- **Micro Projects**
    - **Phase 1 Analysis of Multivariate Quality Control Data for an Industrial Forging Process :** Estimated distribution parameters from within control data point to use it as monitoring scheme for future quality control missions (Phase 2 Analysis).
    
    - **Prediction of Network Intrusion detection by analyzing the TCP/IP dump :** Achieved 75% accuracy with the Random Forest/ Decision Tree model. Analyzed 25193 records along with data cleaning and feature selection of TCP/IP Dump data
    
    - **E-Commerce Sales Analytics Visualization [Tableau] :** Performed data organization, advanced visualization, mapping, enterprise dashboards, and data presentation
